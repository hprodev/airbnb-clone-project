# airbnb-clone-project

## Project Overview

The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

## Project Goals

- **User Management**: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **Property Management**: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
- **Booking System**: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
- **Payment Processing**: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
- **Review System**: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- **Data Optimization**: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## Technology Stack

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- **Django Rest Framework**: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- **GraphQL**: A query language for flexible and efficient data retrieval.
- **Celery**: For asynchronous tasks (like sending notifications).
- **Redis**: Used for caching and session management.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Team Roles and Responsibilities

- **Backend Developer**: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, algorithms, database schemas, and business logic.
- **Database Administrator**: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
- **DevOps Engineer**: Builds continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for faster delivery, handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
- **QA Engineer**: Ensures the backend functional and non-functional requirements are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

## Database Design

- **Payments**:
  - `payment_id`: Unique identifier for the payment (Primary Key).
  - `booking_id`: Foreign Key referencing the booking associated with the payment.
  - `amount`: Amount paid for the booking.
  - `payment_date`: Timestamp of the payment.
  - `payment_type`: Method of payment (e.g., credit card, PayPal, bank transfer).
  - **Relationship**: A payment belongs to a booking.

- **Properties**:
  - `property_id`: Unique identifier for the property (Primary Key).
  - `owner_id`: Foreign Key referencing the user who owns the property.
  - `title`: Name or short description of the property.
  - `description`: Detailed description of the property.
  - `location`: Physical location (city, address, etc.).
  - `price_per_night`: Current price for booking the property per night.
  - `date_listed`: Timestamp when the property was first listed.
  - `last_price_change_date`: Timestamp of the most recent price update.
  - `price_changed_count`: Total number of times the price has been modified.
  - **Relationship**: A property belongs to a user and can have many bookings and reviews.

- **Bookings**:
  - `booking_id`: Unique identifier for the booking (Primary Key).
  - `user_id`: Foreign Key referencing the user who made the booking.
  - `property_id`: Foreign Key referencing the property being booked.
  - `check_in_date`: Date the booking starts.
  - `check_out_date`: Date the booking ends.
  - **Relationship**: A booking belongs to both a user and a property.

- **Reviews**:
  - `review_id`: Unique identifier for the review (Primary Key).
  - `user_id`: Foreign Key referencing the user who wrote the review.
  - `property_id`: Foreign Key referencing the reviewed property.
  - `rating`: Rating given to the property (1-5).
  - `comment`: Text review from the user.
  - **Relationship**: A review belongs to a user and a property.

- **Payments**:
  - `payment_id`: Unique identifier for the payment (Primary Key).
  - `booking_id`: Foreign Key referencing the booking associated with the payment.
  - `amount`: Amount paid for the booking.
  - `payment_date`: Timestamp of the payment.
  - **Relationship**: A payment belongs to a booking.

## üì¶ Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management

Handles user registration, login, profile updates, and authentication. Ensures secure access and personalized experience for both guests and hosts.

### 2. Property Management

Allows hosts to create, update, view, and delete property listings. Includes pricing, availability, and property details to help attract potential guests.

### 3. Booking System

Enables users to make reservations on listed properties. Tracks check-in/check-out dates, booking status, and handles conflict resolution.

### 4. Payment Processing

Handles secure transaction processing for bookings. Supports multiple payment types (e.g., credit card, PayPal) and records payment details for accountability.

### 5. Review System

Allows guests to leave reviews and ratings for properties after their stay. Helps build trust and transparency on the platform.

### 6. API Documentation

Documents the backend API using the OpenAPI standard. Ensures easy integration and clear reference for frontend developers or third-party tools.

### 7. Database Optimization

Implements indexing and caching strategies to ensure fast and scalable data access. Improves user experience by reducing response times.

## üîê API Security

### 1. Authentication

Only verified users can access protected resources. JWT (JSON Web Tokens) will be used to authenticate users after login.

### 2. Authorization

Restricts access based on user roles and ownership. For example, only property owners can modify their listings, and only verified guests can leave reviews after checkout.

### 3. Rate Limiting

Prevents abuse of the API by limiting the number of requests a user can make in a given time frame. Helps defend against brute-force and DDoS attacks.

### 4. Data Validation & Sanitization

All incoming data is validated to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other malicious input. Protects the integrity and security of the system.

### 5. HTTPS Enforcement

All API communications will be done over HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.

### 6. Payment Security

Payment processing is handled using third-party providers that are PCI-DSS compliant (e.g., Stripe, PayPal). Sensitive payment information is never stored directly in the backend. Instead, secure tokens or transaction references are used to represent payments.

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline

Every time we push code, a robot checks it for bugs, and (if it's happy) ships it off to the cloud. That‚Äôs CI/CD in a nutshell.

### ü§ñ Continuous Integration (CI)

Think of it as a code gatekeeper. When we commit changes:

- Tests run automatically (e.g., "Did we break login?")
- Linting catches code style issues
- If something fails, it won‚Äôt merge ‚Äî simple.

### üöÄ Continuous Deployment (CD)

If all tests pass, we can auto-deploy:

- To a test environment (staging) for safe previews
- Or even straight to production (live app) if we‚Äôre bold

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools We Use

- **GitHub Actions**: Runs our automated checks/workflows
- **Docker**: "It works on my machine" ‚Äî and everyone else‚Äôs
- **Render / Heroku / AWS**: Our app‚Äôs home on the internet

### TL;DR

CI/CD = fewer bugs, faster shipping, happier devs.
